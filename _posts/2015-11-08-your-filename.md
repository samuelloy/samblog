If you know me, you’ll know that I love games. Not video games, or the kind teenage girls ‘don’t got time for’ (which is a lie for what it’s worth), I like card games.

Before you start making calls for a gambling intervention, let me clarify. I play ‘Magic: the Gathering’ which has some similarities to casino games at the higher levels of play, but is usually played for low stakes such as pride, or a reason to leave your mother’s basement. You can find out a bit more about it by watching the documentary Vice did on it [here](http://www.vice.com/video/the-mystical-universe-of-magic-the-gathering-000). It does a good job of showing the higher level players, and how they view it as a mental challenge and a sport, and juxtaposes it with people who create far too much eye contact, breath through their mouths, and shout things like ‘TEN THOUSAND FAERIES’ which makes you wonder how anyone who has played this game has ever tied their own shoelaces.

When Blizzard released Hearthstone, it was as a major competitor to Magic. Magic has always had a terrible electronic and online presence, so a lot of the community got very excited that such a high level developer was getting behind an online card game and jumped on board. I had a look in on some friends playing, but decided that at the time the game was still a little under developed, and that I wasn’t really interested anyway. A year and a half later and I finally gave into the growing consensus that the game was the real deal. I jumped on my computer and went to work.

The game is very polished. The animations are slick and the introductions are both challenging and useful. I could devote an entire article to how annoying I find the sound and overall theme, but as far as I know I’m in the minority there so let’s just say that it’s a matter of taste. I’ve been getting around it by turning the music and sounds off and putting on albums, which as far as alternatives go is always decent and something I go to a lot.

Once you get into the game, it becomes obvious that you can take it as seriously as you want. There are a bunch of pre-constructed decks which are fine, but the competitive scene follows a handful of competitive decks at a time, the community having large levels of success with certain combinations of cards will inevitably lead others to play those same things. As such it's very difficult to compete unless you are also playing these same combinations. These decks are usually made up of harder to find cards, and as such require a bit of devotion to the game to access. You can unlock most things in the game by just buying the expansions and by playing the ‘Arena’ mode to get cards and ‘dust’ (a commodity which allows you to make the cards you’re missing). If all of that is taking too long though, you are able to just buy a bunch of packs of random cards and try your luck.

There is a ranking system which is where most of the competitive play happens. You start at around rank 25, and you earn stars by besting your opponents. Every few stars you attain a new level, however whenever you lose, you also lose a star and can also get knocked back levels. Things are pretty competitive, and this system does a really good job of matching you against opponents of similar skill, where you will likely bounce around between a couple of levels. There are a heap of people out there taking this game seriously, and it’s very much set up for it. There’s even a ‘Legendary’ ranking mode that you can access if you’re good enough. You’ll virtually never see the top players if that’s not your interest though, given they are likely of a much higher level, so don’t worry too much if that isn’t your jam.

As a high level and ultra-competitive game, Hearthstone is only ok. People are out there enjoying it, but no players are really making a bunch of money off it without streaming, unlike other popular ‘E-sports’ or poker. That being said, it’s a cheap and relatively simple game to get into, and with being able to access it on PC, Tablet, and phone, I think it has a unique niche of a highly-competitive game which can be played across a bunch of different platforms. The most important thing at the end of the day for any game is whether or not it’s fun. I think it is, but I also have seen a lot of people become angered by it due to their own competitive nature. I’m a very competitive person myself, and have had a similar experience, so for me it fails the fun test. Because of how well it tailors its experience to your relative skill level it is a very difficult game to not be competitive with, which is fine if you don’t mind losing around half of your matches. For me however, I think I’ll just be keeping to my little squares of cardboard and will be leaving the pixels to someone else.
