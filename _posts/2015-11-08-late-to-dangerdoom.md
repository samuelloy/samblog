## Late to the Party; Dangerdoom: The Mouse and the Mask

### -Reviews of things you already know about-

_I can only assume that like me most people don’t have time to watch, read, or listen to every bit of content that gets put into the world. Things inevitably fall through the cracks, good things. This series will follow the greatest hits of things I’ve missed over the years._

In the early to mid 2000’s the world of popular music was in the grips of Gangster Rap. The genre is still around and even thriving if Doctor Dre’s newest release “Compton” is anything to go by, but it’s not as all-encompassing as it was back then.

When gangster rap was around I was at one of those ages that it was impossible to ignore popular music. I remember thinking that the music was awful, and that the lyrics were disingenuous. Opinionative and spotty, I would tell any of my contemporaries who were willing to listen. There was usually a heated debate which devolved into name calling, and the uneasy resolution that some people liked rap and other people liked music with guitars. Those were the only options, somehow.

It never sat properly with me, because I remember having heard rap music that I did like, and I remember wishing I had a cool older friend who could show me where all the good stuff was hiding.

I was right of course, good rap was being made at the time just like good guitar music (which I wasn’t listening to either), but it wasn’t until 2014 that I found what I consider to be the real golden nugget of that time period; Dangerdoom’s “The Mouse and the Mask”.

This album is the collaboration between two immensely talented individuals, who go by the stage names MF Doom and Dangermouse. MF Doom is a rapper who goes back to the mid 90’s and is responsible for some truly amazing content, both in collaboration and solo. Dangermouse is a producer with a similarly fantastic back history. He’s probably best known for his work with the singer Cee-Lo Green, who are known collectively as Gnarls Barkley.

‘The Mouse and the Mask’ is one of those albums which shows the ‘who’ can be a lot more important than the ‘what’ when it comes to music. The entire album is themed around different cartoon shows hosted on Cartoon Network’s early 2000’s ‘Adult Swim’. The songs are Dangermouse beats with MF Doom rapping over the top, punctuated with samples from the various shows.

Lyrically, MF Doom often uses a particular show to rap about on each track, although will often insert himself into whatever narrative he has going on. He’s a world class rhymer, and possesses a crazy ability to continue to make his words flow through complicated sentences. Because the content is adaptive and largely absurdist, there’s a lot of scope for MF Doom to run free with wherever the sound is going. Part of the reason I think the album is such a rare jewel is how effortlessly good the lyrical content sounds. I’m sure it’s anything but effortless in reality, check out the track ‘Benzie Box’ if you want to hear rhyming the name Gwendolyn sound easy.

The beats on this album are nothing short of spectacular. They’re mostly based around the classic snare, drum and bass line, but they’re all built up much further than that. There is the full range of musical accompaniment, Violin, Trumpets, Glockenspiel, etc. These are legitimate sound tracks in their own rights, and for me are far beyond the majority of backing music I’ve heard in hip-hop and rap (although big shout out to Thundercat’s work on the latest Kendrick Lamar album). The samples Dangermouse works in are quirky and often quite funny, and add something to the levity of the album.
Overall it’s an amazingly unique album, so give it a look if you’re after something a bit different. It’s very good, and I think it’s pretty unlikely you’ve ever heard anything quite like it.
