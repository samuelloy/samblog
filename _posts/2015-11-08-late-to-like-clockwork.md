title: Late to; ...Like Clockwork
---

It’s a strange experience for me, but more and more bands that I have liked for a long time will release am album and I’ll just let it slide. The obsessive teenage fan in me is dying slowly, no longer do I track singles as they drop, and no longer do I make a note in my calendar for an album release.

Queen of the Stone Age’s ‘…Like Clockwork’ is the perfect example of this. QOTSA go way back for me, to a time of pimples and gossip. I remember getting their 2005 release ‘Lullabies to Paralyse’ as a birthday present and making sure I left enough time to it before racing for the bus (which I missed, of course). Later I would see them on five different occasions, catching a drumstick at one of these shows, and a fist at another (not my fault, honest). 

It took me until a couple of months ago to listen to this album. I was snapped out of my ignoring of it by the Kevin Smith / Mark Ronson cover of ‘I sat by the ocean’ (find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCbS2uJ4lEQ)) which really brought their tight song writing back to my attention. Once I gave it a good run, I was suitably impressed (which given my high expectations says a lot). They have always been top tier musicians, so that was never in contention, but the writing and the sound they manage to create is amazingly consistently fantastic. The album sits somewhere in between ‘Lullabies to Paralyse’ and ‘Songs for the Dead’ in sound, which as far as I’m aware is pretty much their golden age. The majority of songs could fit onto either one of those albums. Adding more tracks onto the best albums of one of my favourite bands is going to be a big hit with me, but I also think it goes some of the way to explaining why it took me so long to develop an interest in the album as well.

QOTSA have a long history of creating albums which don’t sound like each other and explore a unique creative direction. This one doesn’t, and given their last release was just a new print of their self-titled 1998 release, I think it would be fair to say  that QOTSA, as a creative enterprise, is pretty much dead. I have a bit of an issue with that, given that it was so much of their appeal, but honestly it happens to most bands at some point. Anyone who has managed to fork out for the amply priced Led Zeppelin and Rolling Stones gigs of the last decade will have gotten their money’s worth, and it’s been an age since either of those bands have released new content. But for me, and for this particular band, I think I was a bit invested in them retaining their creative identity. So when I heard extremely good but unoriginal singles getting released one at a time, I struggled to get myselfr excited by the release.

As they say, hindsight is 20/20, and basically I’ve been a big idiot because this album is EXTREMELY good. The maturity in lyrics as well as a well-balanced music combined with legitimately talented musicians makes this hard not to like. If you aren’t all over QOTSA this is a really good spot to get into the band. I would still argue that Songs for the Deaf is a better and more important record, but in terms of accessibility this is about as good as it gets.

So check it out, and don’t worry about the originality. It doesn’t do anything, so baby what good does it do?
